## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to demonstrate ones ability to utilize python web framework, Flask, to perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operation with a database. 
To fulfill this requirement in a practical approach, an application which allows user to share movie information such as casts, director, images or short clips,
 was built. This
application shall be able to perform the following:
- To add a new movie
- To edit a movie info
- To delete a movie
- To search for a movie by filtering
<br/>

## UX
Realization of this project depends on the availability of users and technologies. Users would be moviegoers or moive reviewers who wants to share 
different types of movie they have watched. This application should fulfill their following needs:

- "I want to have different ways to filter for a particular movie information."
- "I want to know what type of movie which I have just watched."
- "I want to share and add this old movie info to somewhere for others to know."
- "I want to edit and delete movie info which is wrong."
- "I want to know which movies this particular actor/director is casted in."

By using front-end and back-end technologies such as bootstrap, flask, the user's needs can be achieved.<br/>

The minimalist design approach on the styling of the appliation is to allow the content to stand out and be the focal point. Each buttons are designed and styled 
in a similar fashion to allow ease of recognizing interactive features on the application. 
As filtering by genre is a common queries ones will seek before 
reading further about a movie, this application would present a landing page showing different movies filtered by genre. For ease of access to filter movies by year
or genre or keywords and adding movie info, the top bar would be built with these features and available in every pages.

            if file_ext.lower() not in app.config['UPLOAD_EXTENSIONS']:
                errors['poster_ext_is_wrong'] = "Poster file ext is invalid"
            # To validate file size
            elif poster_size > 1024 * 1024:
                errors['poster_size_above_limit'] = "Poster file size cannot be  more than 1MB"

        # To check whether field is empty

### Bugs/Problems Encountered
There are a numbers of bugs or problems encountered during the development of the project. The main ones are as explained below:

- *** Form is not valid post back*** <br>
Intially, whenever an invalid form is posted back to the url, there is no means to verify the invalid causes. It was later found 
out from the django form api that it exists an form.error api to retrieve the problematic form field. Subsequently, all form invalid
was easily resolved.

- *** Render model for all template *** <br>
Intially, 

- *** Status Code 302 response from Stripe Webhook*** <br>
During processing the payment by stripe with webhook enabled, the stripe webhook keeps responding back with a status code 302 even though
payment_completed function was exempted from CSRF. It was found out the "login_required" decorator was added on the payment_completed function
which caused the problem.
