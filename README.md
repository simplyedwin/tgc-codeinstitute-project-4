<p align="center">
<img src="static/images/TBGs.gif" height=340>
</p>

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to demonstrate ones ability to develop a full stack application with django web framework and create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operation with a database. 
To fulfill this requirement in a practical approach, an application which allows user to login or sign up and perform payment was built. This
application shall be able to perform the following:
- To login or sign up an account
- To handle user related information
- To add items to a cart
- To remove items from a cart
- To write review and provide rating for purchased items 
- To make payment
- To search for information of a product
<br/>

## Frontend

### UX
Realization of this project depends on the availability of users and technologies. Users would be indoor plant enthusiast or someone who is looking to "greenify" their 
home due to prolong working from home. This application should fulfill their following needs:

- "I want my room to be more greenery."
- "I want to purchase some plants from an e-commerce shop."
- "I want to know that there are stocks available for the plant that I want to purchase."
- "I want to be able to type and search some information of plants."
- "I want to be able to see maintenance information about some plants."
- "I want to be able to log in to an plant e-commerce shop."
- "I want to be able to sign up an account with an plant e-commerce shop."
- "I want to be able to see the items added to my cart."
- "I want to be able to remove items from my cart."
- "I want to be able to reset my password if I have forgotten it."
- "How many plants can I add to the cart?"
- "How do I know I that I have logged in to the plant e-commerce shop?"
- "How do I know that I have logged out from the plant e-commerce shop?"
- "How do I know that there are errors for the information that I have provided?"

By using front-end and back-end technologies such as bootstrap, django, the user's needs can be achieved.<br/>

The minimalist design approach on the styling of the appliation is to allow the content to stand out and be the focal point. The choice of color used brings in a feel of nature 
to a user visiting the e-commerce shop. Each buttons are designed and styled in a similar fashion to allow ease of recognizing interactive features on the application. To provide
as much information as possible for each plant, meaningful and easy to understand icons are used to show on the shop page (See Fig-2).

### Bugs/Problems Encountered
There are a numbers of bugs or problems encountered during the development of the project. The main ones are as explained below:

- ***Form is not valid post back*** <br>
Intially, whenever an invalid form is posted back to the url, there is no means to verify the invalid causes. It was later found 
out from the django form api that it exists an form.errors api to retrieve the problematic form fields. Subsequently, all form invalid
was easily resolved.

- ***Render model for all template*** <br>
To enhance the user experiences when adding an item into the cart, the cart icon on the navigation bar changed to a filled up icon and 
shows the number of items in the cart. As the cart icon resides in the base template, each template needs to retrieve the cart session information
in order to pass to the base template to render the information. However, as the "login/sign-up" page uses the existing default template, it would
takes some efforts to customize the views for these template in order to retreive and pass the cart session information. Fortuanately, there is a
feature in Django that allows one to pass the model information at global level to all templates and this feature is known as context processor. Hence, 
a context processor module for the cart session was created and solved the problem. The below is an extract of the code:

```
            # this context processor is needed to pass the information of the cart
            # to the base-template.html to render when the user is in the login/signup page

            def cartinfo(request):

                # to determine the qty of items in cart
                cart = request.session.get('shopping_cart', {})

                return {'cart': cart}

```

- ***Status Code 302 response from Stripe Webhook*** <br>
During processing the payment by stripe with webhook enabled, the stripe webhook keeps responding back with a status code 302 even though
payment_completed function was exempted from CSRF. It was found out the "login_required" decorator was added on the payment_completed function
which caused the problem. It was resolved by removing the decorator.


- ***Not scrollable body*** <br>
During the development of the page content, some information of the page cannot be seen even though the page is scrollable. It was later found out that
the height of these pages exceeded the viewing height of the body. This was resolved by dividing the pages into 3 section with different styling
as shown in the below CSS codes. This makes the mainsection of the page to be scrollable and hence, increased the viewing height of the page.   

```
                .navbar {
                    height: 15vh;
                    background-color: #fffaf0;
                }

                .mainsection {
                    flex: 1 0 auto;
                    overflow: auto;
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 15vh;
                    bottom: 10vh;
                }


                .footer {
                    position: absolute;
                    height: 10vh;
                    left: 0;
                    bottom: 0;
                    width: 100%;
                    background-color: #fffaf0;
                    text-align: center;
                }
